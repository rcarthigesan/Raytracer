---GETTING STARTED---

=======================================

Modules submitted:

1.raytracer.py : Module containing all the classes and methods for investigations.
		 Also implements a spherical reflecting class.

2.genpolar.py  : Module containing the polar coordinate generators, used for generating ray bundles.

=======================================

Scripts submitted (all save ray diagrams, input spot diagrams, output plane spot diagrams and calculate the rms spot radius as rms_spot_radius):

1.single_spherical_refracting.py: Models the case of a single spherical refracting surface

2.planoconvex_plane_first.py: Models a planoconvex lens with planar surface facing the input

3.planoconvex_curve_first.py: Models the same case as the "planoconvex_plane_first.py" script, but with the curved surface
			      facing the input.

4.single_spherical_reflecting_concave.py: Models the same case as the "single_spherical_refracting.py" script, but with the
					  surface inverted and reflective so it is a concave spherical mirror.
